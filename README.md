This repository contains the code for the experiments reported in the thesis on using coupling methods for the prediction problem in Reinforcement Learning. 

## GRIDWORLD_EXPERIMENT

This folder contains the gridworld experiment. Both the unbiased estimators for the value function and gain are shown. As well as a comparison between the meeting times of maximal couplings and the coupling that is independent until the meeting time. 

## COBWEB

This folder contains the code for the economic experiment. It compares the gain of various policies. 

## Coupling Figures

This notebook contains some of the figures used to compare the reflection-maximal coupling with the gamma coupling.
